## Description
This project is a data analysis and visualization project focused on analyzing a dataset of properties for sale from the website immoweb.be. The project involves cleaning the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis and creating visualizations to gain insights into the properties and their characteristics.
In addition to the data analysis and visualization, this project also incorporates machine learning (ML) techniques to build predictive models for property prices based on various features. Three different ML methods have been utilized to create these models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and XGBoost Regression.
